# Grizzly NIO

Writing scalable server applications in the Java™ programming language
has always been difficult. Before the advent of the Java New I/O API (NIO),
thread management issues made it impossible for a server to scale to
thousands of users. The Grizzly NIO framework has been designed to help
developers to take advantage of the Java™ NIO API. Grizzly’s goal is to
help developers to build scalable and robust servers using NIO as well
as offering extended framework components: Web Framework (HTTP/S),
WebSocket, Comet, and more!

## Getting Started

Grizzly currently has several lines of development in the following
branches:

- 2.3.x : This is the sustaining branch for 2.3. (latest release is 2.3.33)
- master : This is the sustaining branch for the most recent major release of Grizzly. (latest release is 2.4.2)
- 3.0.x : This is our upcoming 3.0 release.  Fair warning; it's not backwards compatible with previous releases.

There are other branches for older releases of Grizzly that we don't
actively maintain at this time, but we keep them for the history.


### Prerequisites

We have different JDK requirements depending on the branch in use:

- Oracle JDK 1.8 for master and 3.0.x branches.
- Oracle JDK 1.7 for 2.3.x.

Apache Maven 3.3.9 or later in order to build and run the tests.

### Installing
